This project is a web application developed in ASP.NET with C# and SQL Server that allows a technical support department to manage requests or incidents reported by users efficiently.

The system allows you to register tickets, auto-assign them, change their status (active, pending, resolved, canceled), and keep visual control of the follow-up through categorized tabs. 
A module is also included to attach PDF evidence and rate the care received.
